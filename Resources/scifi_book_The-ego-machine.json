After all, who wants toargue like Disraeli or live like Ivan the Terrible?]INicholas Martin looked up at the robot across the desk.Im not going to ask what you want, he said, in a low, restrainedvoice. I already know. Just go away and tell St. Cyr I approve. Tellhim I think its wonderful, putting a robot in the picture. Weve hadeverything else by now, except the Rockettes. But clearly a quiet littleplay about Christmas among the Portuguese fishermen on the Florida coast_must_ have a robot. Only, why not six robots? Tell him I suggest abakers dozen. Go away.Was your mothers name Helena Glinska? the robot asked.It was not, Martin said.Ah, then she must have been the Great Hairy One, the robot murmured.Martin took his feet off the desk and sat up slowly.Its quite all right, the robot said hastily. Youve been chosen foran ecological experiment, thats all. But it wont hurt. Robots areperfectly normal life forms where I come from, so you neednt--Shut up, Martin said. Robot indeed, you--you bit-player! This timeSt. Cyr has gone too far. He began to shake slightly all over, withsome repressed but strong emotion. The intercom box on the desk caughthis eye, and he stabbed a finger at one of the switches. Get me MissAshby! Right away!Im so sorry, the robot said apologetically. Have I made a mistake?The threshold fluctuations in the neurons always upset my mnemonic normwhen I temporalize. Isnt this a crisis-point in your life?Martin breathed hard, which seemed to confirm the robots assumption.Exactly, it said. The ecological imbalance approaches a peak that maydestroy the life-form, unless ... mm-m. Now either youre about to bestepped on by a mammoth, locked in an iron mask, assassinated by helots,or--is this Sanskrit Im speaking? He shook his gleaming head. PerhapsI should have got off fifty years ago, but I thought--sorry. Good-bye,he added hastily as Martin raised an angry glare.Then the robot lifted a finger to each corner of his naturally rigidmouth, and moved his fingers horizontally in opposite directions, asthough sketching an apologetic smile.No, dont go away, Martin said. I want you right here, where thesight of you can refuel my rage in case its needed. I wish to God Icould get mad and stay mad, he added plaintively, gazing at thetelephone.Are you sure your mothers name wasnt Helena Glinska? the robotasked. It pinched thumb and forefinger together between its nominalbrows, somehow giving the impression of a worried frown.Naturally Im sure, Martin snapped.You arent married yet, then? To Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina?Not yet or ever, Martin replied succinctly. The telephone rang. Hesnatched it up.        *        *       *        *        *Hello, Nick, said Erika Ashbys calm voice. Something wrong?Instantly the fires of rage went out of Martins eyes, to be replaced bya tender, rose-pink glow. For some years now he had given Erika, hisvery competent agent, ten percent of his take. He had also longedhopelessly to give her approximately a pound of flesh--the cardiacmuscle, to put it in cold, unromantic terms. Martin did not; he put itin no terms at all, since whenever he tried to propose marriage to Erikahe was taken with such fits of modesty that he could only babble ogreen fields.Well, Erika repeated. Something wrong?Yes, Martin said, drawing a long breath. Can St. Cyr make me marrysomebody named Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina?What a wonderful memory you have, the robot put in mournfully. Mineused to be, before I started temporalizing. But even radioactive neuronswont stand--Nominally youre still entitled to life, liberty, et cetera, Erikasaid. But Im busy right now, Nick. Cant it wait till I see you?When?Didnt you get my message? Erika demanded.Of course not, Martin said, angrily. Ive suspected for some timethat all my incoming calls have to be cleared by St. Cyr. Somebody mighttry to smuggle in a word of hope, or possibly a file. His voicebrightened. Planning a jailbreak?Oh, this is outrageous, Erika said. Some day St. Cyrs going to gotoo far--Not while hes got DeeDee behind him, Martin said gloomily. SummitStudios would sooner have made a film promoting atheism than offendtheir top box-office star, DeeDee Fleming. Even Tolliver Watt, who ownedSummit lock, stock and barrel, spent wakeful nights because St. Cyrrefused to let the lovely DeeDee sign a long-term contract.Nevertheless, Watts no fool, Erika said. I still think we could gethim to give you a contract release if we could make him realize what arotten investment you are. There isnt much time, though.Why not?I told you--oh. Of course you dont know. Hes leaving for Paristomorrow morning.Martin moaned. Then Im doomed, he said. Theyll pick up my optionautomatically next week and Ill never draw a free breath again. Erika,do something!Im going to, Erika said. Thats exactly what I want to see youabout. Ah, she added suddenly, now I understand why St. Cyr stopped mymessage. He was afraid. Nick, do you know what weve got to do?See Watt? Nick hazarded unhappily. But Erika--See Watt _alone_, Erika amplified.Not if St. Cyr can help it, Nick reminded her.Exactly. Naturally St. Cyr doesnt want us to talk to Watt privately.We might make him see reason. But this time, Nick, weve simply got tomanage it somehow. One of us is going to talk to Watt while the otherkeeps St. Cyr at bay. Which do you choose?Neither, Martin said promptly.Oh, Nick! I cant do the whole thing alone. Anybodyd think you wereafraid of St. Cyr.I _am_ afraid of St. Cyr, Martin said.Nonsense. What could he actually do to you?He could terrorize me. He does it all the time. Erika, he says Imindoctrinating beautifully. Doesnt it make your blood run cold? Look atall the other writers hes indoctrinated.I know. I saw one of them on Main Street last week, delving intogarbage cans. Do you want to end up that way? Then stand up for yourrights!Ah, said the robot wisely, nodding. Just as I thought. Acrisis-point.Shut up, Martin said. No, not you, Erika. Im sorry.So am I, Erika said tartly. For a moment I thought youd acquired abackbone.If I were somebody like Hemingway-- Martin began in a miserable voice.Did you say Hemingway? the robot inquired. Is this theKinsey-Hemingway era? Then I must be right. Youre Nicholas Martin, thenext subject. Martin, Martin? Let me see--oh yes, the Disraeli type,thats it. He rubbed his forehead with a grating sound. Oh, my poorneuron thresholds! Now I remember.        *        *       *        *        *Nick, can you hear me? Erikas voice inquired. Im coming over thereright away. Brace yourself. Were going to beard St. Cyr in his den andconvince Watt youll never make a good screen-writer. Now--But St. Cyr wont _ever_ admit that, Martin cried. He doesnt knowthe meaning of the word failure. He says so. Hes going to make me intoa screen-writer or kill me.Remember what happened to Ed Cassidy? Erika reminded him grimly. St.Cyr didnt make him into a screen-writer.True. Poor old Ed, Martin said, with a shiver.All right, then. Im on my way. Anything else?Yes! Martin cried, drawing a deep breath. Yes, there is! I love youmadly!But the words never got past his glottis. Opening and closing his mouthnoiselessly, the cowardly playwright finally clenched his teeth andtried again. A faint, hopeless squeak vibrated the telephones disk.Martin let his shoulders slump hopelessly. It was clear he could neverpropose to anybody, not even a harmless telephone.Did you say something? Erika asked. Well, good-bye then.Wait a minute, Martin said, his eyes suddenly falling once more uponthe robot. Speechless on one subject only, he went on rapidly, I forgotto tell you. Watt and the nest-fouling St. Cyr have just hired a mock-upphony robot to play in _Angelina Noel_!But the line was dead.Im not a phony, the robot said, hurt.Martin fell back in his chair and stared at his guest with dull,hopeless eyes. Neither was King Kong, he remarked. Dont startfeeding me some line St. Cyrs told you to pull. I know hes trying tobreak my nerve. Hell probably do it, too. Look what hes done to myplay already. Why Fred Waring? I dont mind Fred Waring in his properplace. There hes fine. But not in _Angelina Noel_. Not as thePortuguese captain of a fishing boat manned by his entire band,accompanied by Dan Dailey singing _Napoli_ to DeeDee Fleming in amermaids tail--Self-stunned by this recapitulation, Martin put his arms on the desk,his head in his hands, and to his horror found himself giggling. Thetelephone rang. Martin groped for the instrument without rising from hissemi-recumbent position.Who? he asked shakily. _Who?_ St. Cyr--A hoarse bellow came over the wire. Martin sat bolt upright, seizing thephone desperately with both hands.Listen! he cried. Will you let me finish what Im going to say, justfor once? Putting a robot in _Angelina Noel_ is simply--I do not hear what you say, roared a heavy voice. Your idea stinks.Whatever it is. Be at Theater One for yesterdays rushes! At once!But wait--St. Cyr belched and hung up. Martins strangling hands tightened brieflyon the telephone. But it was no use. The real strangle-hold was the oneSt. Cyr had around Martins throat, and it had been tightening now fornearly thirteen weeks. Or had it been thirteen years? Looking backward,Martin could scarcely believe that only a short time ago he had been afree man, a successful Broadway playwright, the author of the hit play_Angelina Noel_. Then had come St. Cyr....A snob at heart, the director loved getting his clutches on hit playsand name writers. Summit Studios, he had roared at Martin, would followthe original play exactly and would give Martin the final okay on thescript, provided he signed a thirteen-week contract to help write thescreen treatment. This had seemed too good to be true--and was.Martins downfall lay partly in the fine print and partly in the factthat Erika Ashby had been in the hospital with a bad attack of influenzaat the time. Buried in legal verbiage was a clause that bound Martin tofive years of servitude with Summit should they pick up his option. Nextweek they would certainly do just that, unless justice prevailed.        *        *       *        *        *I think I need a drink, Martin said unsteadily. Or several. Heglanced toward the robot. I wonder if youd mind getting me that bottleof Scotch from the bar over there.But I am here to conduct an experiment in optimum ecology, said therobot.Martin closed his eyes. Pour me a drink, he pleaded. Please. Then putthe glass in my hand, will you? Its not much to ask. After all, wereboth human beings, arent we?Well, no, the robot said, placing a brimming glass in Martins gropingfingers. Martin drank. Then he opened his eyes and blinked at the tallhighball glass in his hand. The robot had filled it to the brim withScotch. Martin turned a wondering gaze on his metallic companion.You must do a lot of drinking yourself, he said thoughtfully. Isuppose tolerance can be built up. Go ahead. Help yourself. Take therest of the bottle.The robot placed the tip of a finger above each eye and slid the fingersupward, as though raising his eyebrows inquiringly.Go on, have a jolt, Martin urged. Or dont you want to break breadwith me, under the circumstances?How can I? the robot asked. Im a robot. His voice sounded somewhatwistful. What happens? he inquired. Is it a lubricatory or a fuelingmechanism?Martin glanced at his brimming glass.Fueling, he said tersely. High octane. You really believe in stayingin character, dont you? Why not--Oh, the principle of irritation, the robot interrupted. I see. Justlike fermented mammoths milk.Martin choked. Have you ever drunk fermented mammoths milk? heinquired.How could I? the robot asked. But Ive seen it done. He drew astraight line vertically upward between his invisible eyebrows, managingto look wistful. Of course my world is perfectly functional andfunctionally perfect, but I cant help finding temporalizing afascina-- He broke off. Im wasting space-time. Ah. Now. Mr. Martin,would you be willing to--Oh, have a drink, Martin said. I feel hospitable. Go ahead, indulgeme, will you? My pleasures are few. And Ive got to go and be terrorizedin a minute, anyhow. If you cant get that mask off Ill send for astraw. You can step out of character long enough for one jolt, cantyou?Id like to try it, the robot said pensively. Ever since I noticedthe effect fermented mammoths milk had on the boys, its been on mymind, rather. Quite easy for a human, of course. Technically its simpleenough, I see now. The irritation just increases the frequency of thebrains kappa waves, as with boosted voltage, but since electricalvoltage never existed in pre-robot times--It did, Martin said, taking another drink. I mean, it does. What doyou call that, a mammoth? He indicated the desk lamp.The robots jaw dropped.That? he asked in blank amazement. Why--why then all those telephonepoles and dynamos and lighting-equipment I noticed in this era arepowered by electricity!What did you think they were powered by? Martin asked coldly.Slaves, the robot said, examining the lamp. He switched it on,blinked, and then unscrewed the bulb. Voltage, you say?Dont be a fool, Martin said. Youre overplaying your part. Ive gotto get going in a minute. Do you want a jolt or dont you?Well, the robot said, I dont want to seem unsociable. This _ought_to work. So saying, he stuck his finger in the lamp-socket. There was abrief, crackling flash. The robot withdrew his finger._F(t)_-- he said, and swayed slightly. Then his fingers came up andsketched a smile that seemed, somehow, to express delighted surprise._Fff(t)!_ he said, and went on rather thickly, _F(t)_ integralbetween plus and minus infinity ... _a-sub-n_ to _e_....Martins eyes opened wide with shocked horror. Whether a doctor or apsychiatrist should be called in was debatable, but it was perfectlyevident that this was a case for the medical profession, and the soonerthe better. Perhaps the police, too. The bit-player in the robot suitwas clearly as mad as a hatter. Martin poised indecisively, waiting forhis lunatic guest either to drop dead or spring at his throat.The robot appeared to be smacking his lips, with faint clicking sounds.Why, thats wonderful, he said. AC, too.Y-youre not dead? Martin inquired shakily.Im not even alive, the robot murmured. The way youd understand it,that is. Ah--thanks for the jolt.        *        *       *        *        *Martin stared at the robot with the wildest dawning of surmise.Why-- he gasped. Why--_youre a robot_!Certainly Im a robot, his guest said. What slow minds you pre-robotshad. Mines working like lightning now. He stole a drunkards glance atthe desk-lamp. _F(t)_--I mean, if you counted the kappa waves of myradio-atomic brain now, youd be amazed how the frequencys increased.He paused thoughtfully. _F(t)_, he added.Moving quite slowly, like a man under water, Martin lifted his glass anddrank whiskey. Then, cautiously, he looked up at the robot again._F(t)_-- he said, paused, shuddered, and drank again. That did it.Im drunk, he said with an air of shaken relief. That must be it. Iwas almost beginning to believe--Oh, nobody believes Im a robot at first, the robot said. Youllnotice I showed up in a movie lot, where I wouldnt arouse suspicion.Ill appear to Ivan Vasilovich in an alchemists lab, and hell jump tothe conclusive Im an automaton. Which, of course, I _am_. Then theresa Uighur on my list--Ill appear to him in a shamans hut and hellassume Im a devil. A matter of ecologicologic.Then youre a devil? Martin inquired, seizing on the only plausiblesolution.No, no, no. Im a robot. Dont you understand anything?I dont even know who I am, now, Martin said. For all I know, Im afaun and youre a human child. I dont think this Scotch is doing me asmuch good as Id--Your name is Nicholas Martin, the robot said patiently. And mine isENIAC.Eniac?ENIAC, the robot corrected, capitalizing. ENIAC Gamma theNinety-Third.So saying, he unslung a sack from his metallic shoulder and began torummage out length upon length of what looked like red silk ribbon witha curious metallic lustre. After approximately a quarter-mile of it hadappeared, a crystal football helmet emerged attached to its end. Agleaming red-green stone was set on each side of the helmet.Just over the temporal lobes, you see, the robot explained, indicatingthe jewels. Now you just set it on your head, like this--Oh no I dont, Martin said, withdrawing his head with the utmostrapidity. Neither do you, my friend. Whats the idea? I dont like thelooks of that gimmick. I particularly dont like those two red garnetson the sides. They look like eyes.Those are artificial eclogite, the robot assured him. They simplyhave a high dielectric constant. Its merely a matter of altering thenormal thresholds of the neuron memory-circuits. All thinking is basedon memory, you know. The strength of your associations--the emotionalindices of your memories--channel your actions and decisions, and theecologizer simply changes the voltage of your brain so the thresholdsare altered.Is that all it does? Martin asked suspiciously.Well, now, the robot said with a slight air of evasion. I didntintend to mention it, but since you ask--it also imposes themaster-matrix of your character type. But since thats the prototype ofyour character in the first place, it will simply enable you to make themost of your potential ability, hereditary and acquired. It will makeyou react to your environment in the way that best assures yoursurvival.Not me, it wont, Martin said firmly. Because you arent going to putthat thing on my head.The robot sketched a puzzled frown. Oh, he said after a pause. Ihavent explained yet, have I? Its very simple. Would you be willing totake part in a valuable socio-cultural experiment for the benefit of allmankind?No, Martin said.But you dont know what it is yet, the robot said plaintively. Youllbe the only one to refuse, after Ive explained everything thoroughly.By the way, can you understand me all right?Martin laughed hollowly. Natch, he said.Good, the robot said, relieved. That may be one trouble with mymemory. I had to record so many languages before I could temporalize.Sanskrits very simple, but medieval Russians confusing, and as forUighur--however! The purpose of this experiment is to promote the mostsuccessful pro-survival relationship between man and his environment.Instant adaptation is what were aiming at, and we hope to get it byminimizing the differential between individual and environment. In otherwords, the right reaction at the right time. Understand?Of course not, Martin said. What nonsense you talk.There are, the robot said rather wearily, only a limited number ofcharacter matrices possible, depending first on the arrangement of thegenes within the chromosomes, and later upon environmental additions.Since environments tend to repeat--like societies, you know--anorganizational pattern isnt hard to lay out, along the Kaldekooztime-scale. You follow me so far?By the Kaldekooz time-scale, yes, Martin said.I was always lucid, the robot remarked a little vainly, nourishing aswirl of red ribbon.Keep that thing away from me, Martin complained. Drunk I may be, butI have no intention of sticking my neck out that far.Of course youll do it, the robot said firmly. Nobodys ever refusedyet. And dont bicker with me or youll get me confused and Ill have totake another jolt of voltage. Then theres no telling how confused Illbe. My memory gives me enough trouble when I temporalize. Time-travelalways raises the synaptic delay threshold, but the trouble is its sovariable. Thats why I got you mixed up with Ivan at first. But I dontvisit him till after Ive seen you--Im running the testchronologically, and nineteen-fifty-two comes before fifteen-seventy, ofcourse.It doesnt, Martin said, tilting the glass to his lips. Not even inHollywood does nineteen-fifty-two come before fifteen-seventy.Im using the Kaldekooz time-scale, the robot explained. But reallyonly for convenience. Now do you want the ideal ecological differentialor dont you? Because-- Here he flourished the red ribbon again, peeredinto the helmet, looked narrowly at Martin, and shook his head.Im sorry, the robot said. Im afraid this wont work. Your headstoo small. Not enough brain-room, I suppose. This helmets for an eightand a half head, and yours is much too--My head _is_ eight and a half, Martin protested with dignity.Cant be, the robot said cunningly. If it were, the helmet would fit,and it doesnt. Too big.It does fit, Martin said.Thats the trouble with arguing with pre-robot species, ENIAC said, asto himself. Low, brutish, unreasoning. No wonder, when their heads areso small. Now Mr. Martin-- He spoke as though to a small, stupid,stubborn child. Try to understand. This helmets size eight and a half.Your head is unfortunately so very small that the helmet wouldnt fit--Blast it! cried the infuriated Martin, caution quite lost betweenScotch and annoyance. It does fit! Look here! Recklessly he snatchedthe helmet and clapped it firmly on his head. It fits perfectly!I erred, the robot acknowledged, with such a gleam in his eye thatMartin, suddenly conscious of his rashness, jerked the helmet from hishead and dropped it on the desk. ENIAC quietly picked it up and put itback into his sack, stuffing the red ribbon in after it with rapidmotions. Martin watched, baffled, until ENIAC had finished, gatheredtogether the mouth of the sack, swung it on his shoulder again, andturned toward the door.Good-bye, the robot said. And thank you.For what? Martin demanded.For your cooperation, the robot said.I wont cooperate, Martin told him flatly. Its no use. Whatever fooltreatment it is youre selling, Im not going to--Oh, youve already had the ecology treatment, ENIAC replied blandly.Ill be back tonight to renew the charge. It lasts only twelve hours._What!_ENIAC moved his forefingers outward from the corners of his mouth,sketching a polite smile. Then he stepped through the door and closed itbehind him.Martin made a faint squealing sound, like a stuck but gagged pig._Something was happening inside his head._IINicholas Martin felt like a man suddenly thrust under an ice-coldshower. No, not cold--steaming hot. Perfumed, too. The wind that blew infrom the open window bore with it a frightful stench of gasoline,sagebrush, paint, and--from the distant commissary--ham sandwiches.Drunk, he thought frantically. Im drunk--or crazy! He sprang up andspun around wildly; then catching sight of a crack in the hardwood floorhe tried to walk along it. Because if I can walk a straight line, hethought, Im not drunk. Im only crazy.... It was not a verycomforting thought.He could walk it, all right. He could walk a far straighter line thanthe crack, which he saw now was microscopically jagged. He had, in fact,never felt such a sense of location and equilibrium in his life. Hisexperiment carried him across the room to a wall-mirror, and as hestraightened to look into it, suddenly all confusion settled and ceased.The violent sensory perceptions leveled off and returned to normal.Everything was quiet. Everything was all right.Martin met his own eyes in the mirror.Everything was _not_ all right.He was stone cold sober. The Scotch he had drunk might as well have beenspring-water. He leaned closer to the mirror, trying to stare throughhis own eyes into the depths of his brain. For something extremely oddwas happening in there. All over his brain, tiny shutters were beginningto move, some sliding up till only a narrow crack remained, throughwhich the beady little eyes of neurons could be seen peeping, somesliding down with faint crashes, revealing the agile, spidery forms ofstill other neurons scuttling for cover.Altered thresholds, changing the yes-and-no reaction time of thememory-circuits, with their key emotional indices and associations ...huh?The robot!Martins head swung toward the closed office door. But he made nofurther move. The look of blank panic on his face very slowly, quiteunconsciously, began to change. The robot ... could wait.Automatically Martin raised his hand, as though to adjust an invisiblemonocle. Behind him, the telephone began to ring. Martin glanced at it.His lips curved into an insolent smile.Flicking dust from his lapel with a suave gesture, Martin picked up thetelephone. He said nothing. There was a long silence. Then a hoarsevoice shouted, Hello, hello, hello! Are you there? You, Martin!Martin said absolutely nothing at all.You keep me waiting, the voice bellowed. Me, St. Cyr! Now jump! Therushes are ... Martin, do you hear me?Martin gently laid down the receiver on the desk. He turned again towardthe mirror, regarded himself critically, frowned.Dreary, he murmured. Distinctly dreary. I wonder why I ever boughtthis necktie?The softly bellowing telephone distracted him. He studied the instrumentbriefly, then clapped his hands sharply together an inch from themouthpiece. There was a sharp, anguished cry from the other end of theline.Very good, Martin murmured, turning away. That robot has done me aconsiderable favor. I should have realized the possibilities sooner.After all, a super-machine, such as ENIAC, would be far cleverer than aman, who is merely an ordinary machine. Yes, he added, stepping intothe hall and coming face to face with Toni LaMotta, who was currentlyworking for Summit on loan. _Man is a machine, and woman--_ Here hegave Miss LaMotta a look of such arrogant significance that she wasquite startled._And woman--a toy_, Martin amplified, as he turned toward TheaterOne, where St. Cyr and destiny awaited him.        *        *       *        *        *Summit Studios, outdoing even MGM, always shot ten times as much footageas necessary on every scene. At the beginning of each shooting day, thisconfusing mass of celluloid was shown in St. Cyrs private projectiontheater, a small but luxurious domed room furnished with lie-back chairsand every other convenience, though no screen was visible until youlooked up. Then you saw it on the ceiling.When Martin entered, it was instantly evident that ecology took a suddenshift toward the worse. Operating on the theory that the old NicholasMartin had come into it, the theater, which had breathed an expensiveair of luxurious confidence, chilled toward him. The nap of the Persianrug shrank from his contaminating feet. The chair he stumbled against inthe half-light seemed to shrug contemptuously. And the three people inthe theater gave him such a look as might be turned upon one of thelarger apes who had, by sheer accident, got an invitation to BuckinghamPalace.DeeDee Fleming (her real name was impossible to remember, besides havingnot a vowel in it) lay placidly in her chair, her feet comfortably up,her lovely hands folded, her large, liquid gaze fixed upon the screenwhere DeeDee Fleming, in the silvery meshes of a technicolor mermaid,swam phlegmatically through seas of pearl-colored mist.Martin groped in the gloom for a chair. The strangest things were goingon inside his brain, where tiny stiles still moved and readjusted untilhe no longer felt in the least like Nicholas Martin. Who did he feellike, then? What had happened?He recalled the neurons whose beady little eyes he had fancied he sawstaring brightly into, as well as out of, his own. Or had he? The memorywas vivid, yet it couldnt be, of course. The answer was perfectlysimple and terribly logical. ENIAC Gamma the Ninety-Third had told him,somewhat ambiguously, just what his ecological experiment involved.Martin had merely been given the optimum reactive pattern of hissuccessful prototype, a man who had most thoroughly controlled his ownenvironment. And ENIAC had told him the mans name, along with severalconfusing references to other prototypes like an Ivan (who?) and anunnamed Uighur.The name for Martins prototype was, of course, Disraeli, Earl ofBeaconsfield. Martin had a vivid recollection of George Arliss playingthe role. Clever, insolent, eccentric in dress and manner, exuberant,suave, self-controlled, with a strongly perceptive imagination....No, no, no! DeeDee said with a sort of calm impatience. Be careful,Nick. Some other chair, please. I have my feet on this one.T-t-t-t-t, said Raoul St. Cyr, protruding his thick lips and snappingthe fingers of an enormous hand as he pointed to a lowly chair againstthe wall. Behind me, Martin. Sit down, sit down. Out of our way. Now!Pay attention. Study what I have done to make something great out ofyour foolish little play. Especially note how I have so cleverly endedthe solo by building to five cumulative pratt-falls. Timing is all, hefinished. Now--SILENCE!For a man born in the obscure little Balkan country of Mixo-Lydia, RaoulSt. Cyr had done very well for himself in Hollywood. In 1939 St. Cyr,growing alarmed at the imminence of war, departed for America, takingwith him the print of an unpronounceable Mixo-Lydian film he had made,which might be translated roughly as _The Pores In the Face of thePeasant_.With this he established his artistic reputation as a great director,though if the truth were known, it was really poverty that caused _ThePores_ to be so artistically lighted, and simple drunkenness which hadmade most of the cast act out one of the strangest performances in filmhistory. But critics compared _The Pores_ to a ballet and praisedinordinately the beauty of its leading lady, now known to the world asDeeDee Fleming.DeeDee was so incredibly beautiful that the law of compensation wouldforce one to expect incredible stupidity as well. One was notdisappointed. DeeDees neurons didnt know _anything_. She had heard ofemotions, and under St. Cyrs bullying could imitate a few of them, butother directors had gone mad trying to get through the semantic blockthat kept DeeDees mind a calm, unruffled pool possibly three inchesdeep. St. Cyr merely bellowed. This simple, primordial approach seemedto be the only one that made sense to Summits greatest investment andtop star.With this whip-hand over the beautiful and brainless DeeDee, St. Cyrquickly rose to the top in Hollywood. He had undoubted talent. He couldmake one picture very well indeed. He had made it twenty times already,each time starring DeeDee, and each time perfecting his own feudalisticproduction unit. Whenever anyone disagreed with St. Cyr, he had only tothreaten to go over to MGM and take the obedient DeeDee with him, for hehad never allowed her to sign a long-term contract and she worked onlyon a picture-to-picture basis. Even Tolliver Watt knuckled under whenSt. Cyr voiced the threat of removing DeeDee.        *        *       *        *        *Sit down, Martin, Tolliver Watt said. He was a tall, lean,hatchet-faced man who looked like a horse being starved because he wastoo proud to eat hay. With calm, detached omnipotence he inclined hisgrey-shot head a millimeter, while a faintly pained expression passedfleetingly across his face.Highball, please, he said.A white-clad waiter appeared noiselessly from nowhere and glided forwardwith a tray. It was at this point that Martin felt the last stilesreadjust in his brain, and entirely on impulse he reached out and tookthe frosted highball glass from the tray. Without observing this thewaiter glided on and presented Watt with a gleaming salver full ofnothing. Watt and the waiter regarded the tray.Then their eyes met. There was a brief silence.Here, Martin said, replacing the glass. Much too weak. Get meanother, please. Im reorienting toward a new phase, which means adifferent optimum, he explained to the puzzled Watt as he readjusted achair beside the great man and dropped into it. Odd that he had neverbefore felt at ease during rushes. Right now he felt fine. Perfectly atease. Relaxed.Scotch and soda for Mr. Martin, Watt said calmly. And another forme.So, so, so, now we begin, St. Cyr cried impatiently. He spoke into ahand microphone. Instantly the screen on the ceiling flickered noisilyand began to unfold a series of rather ragged scenes in which a chorusof mermaids danced on their tails down the street of a little Floridafishing village.To understand the full loathsomeness of the fate facing Nicholas Martin,it is necessary to view a St. Cyr production. It seemed to Martin thathe was watching the most noisome movie ever put upon film. He wasconscious that St. Cyr and Watt were stealing rather mystified glancesat him. In the dark he put up two fingers and sketched a robot-likegrin. Then, feeling sublimely sure of himself, he lit a cigarette andchuckled aloud.You laugh? St. Cyr demanded with instant displeasure. You do notappreciate great art? What do you know about it, eh? Are you a genius?This, Martin said urbanely, is the most noisome movie ever put onfilm.In the sudden, deathly quiet which followed, Martin flicked asheselegantly and added, With my help, you may yet avoid becoming thelaughing stock of the whole continent. Every foot of this picture mustbe junked. Tomorrow bright and early we will start all over, and--Watt said quietly, Were quite competent to make a film out of_Angelina Noel_, Martin.It is artistic! St. Cyr shouted. And it will make money, too!Bah, money! Martin said cunningly. He flicked more ash with a lavishgesture. Who cares about money? Let Summit worry.Watt leaned forward to peer searchingly at Martin in the dimness.Raoul, he said, glancing at St. Cyr, I understood you were gettingyour--ah--your new writers whipped into shape. This doesnt sound to meas if--Yes, yes, yes, yes, St. Cyr cried excitedly. Whipped into shape,exactly! A brief delirium, eh? Martin, you feel well? You feelyourself?Martin laughed with quiet confidence. Never fear, he said. The moneyyou spend on me is well worth what Ill bring you in prestige. I quiteunderstand. Our confidential talks were not to be secret from Watt, ofcourse.What confidential talks? bellowed St. Cyr thickly, growing red.We need keep nothing from Watt, need we? Martin went on imperturably.You hired me for prestige, and prestige youll get, if you can onlykeep your big mouth shut long enough. Ill make the name of St. Cyrglorious for you. Naturally you may lose something at the box-office,but its well worth--_Pjrzqxgl!_ roared St. Cyr in his native tongue, and he lumbered upfrom the chair, brandishing the microphone in an enormous, hairy hand.Deftly Martin reached out and twitched it from his grasp.Stop the film, he ordered crisply.It was very strange. A distant part of his mind knew that normally hewould never have dared behave this way, but he felt convinced that neverbefore in his life had he acted with complete normality. He glowed witha giddy warmth of confidence that everything he did would be right, atleast while the twelve-hour treatment lasted....        *        *       *        *        *The screen flickered hesitantly, then went blank.Turn the lights on, Martin ordered the unseen presence beyond themike. Softly and suddenly the room glowed with illumination. And uponthe visages of Watt and St. Cyr he saw a mutual dawning uneasiness beginto break.He had just given them food for thought. But he had given them more thanthat. He tried to imagine what moved in the minds of the two men, belowthe suspicions he had just implanted. St. Cyrs was fairly obvious. TheMixo-Lydian licked his lips--no mean task--and studied Martin withuneasy little bloodshot eyes. Clearly Martin had acquired confidencefrom somewhere. What did it mean? What secret sin of St. Cyrs had beendiscovered to him, what flaw in his contract, that he dared behave sodefiantly?Tolliver Watt was a horse of another color; apparently the man had noguilty secrets; but he too looked uneasy. Martin studied the proud faceand probed for inner weaknesses. Watt would be a harder nut to crack.But Martin could do it.That last underwater sequence, he now said, pursuing his theme. Puretrash, you know. Itll have to come out. The whole scene must be shotfrom under water.Shut up! St. Cyr shouted violently.But it must, you know, Martin went on. Or it wont jibe with the newstuff Ive written in. In fact, Im not at all certain that the wholepicture shouldnt be shot under water. You know, we could use thedocumentary technique--Raoul, Watt said suddenly, whats this man trying to do?He is trying to break his contract, of course, St. Cyr said, turningruddy olive. It is the bad phase all my writers go through before I getthem whipped into shape. In Mixo-Lydia--Are you sure hell whip into shape? Watt asked.To me this is now a personal matter, St. Cyr said, glaring at Martin.I have spent nearly thirteen weeks on this man and I do not intend towaste my valuable time on another. I tell you he is simply trying tobreak his contract--tricks, tricks, tricks.Are you? Watt asked Martin coldly.Not now, Martin said. Ive changed my mind. My agent insists Id bebetter off away from Summit. In fact, she has the curious feeling that Iand Summit would suffer by a mesalliance. But for the first time Im notsure I agree. I begin to see possibilities, even in the tripe St. Cyrhas been stuffing down the publics throat for years. Of course I cantwork miracles all at once. Audiences have come to expect garbage fromSummit, and theyve even been conditioned to like it. But well begin ina small way to re-educate them with this picture. I suggest we try tosymbolize the Existentialist hopelessness of it all by ending the filmwith a full four hundred feet of seascapes--nothing but vast, heavingstretches of ocean, he ended, on a note of complacent satisfaction.A vast, heaving stretch of Raoul St. Cyr rose from his chair andadvanced upon Martin.Outside, outside! he shouted. Back to your cell, you double-crossingvermin! I, Raoul St. Cyr, command it. Outside, before I rip you limbfrom limb--Martin spoke quickly. His voice was calm, but he knew he would have towork fast.You see, Watt? he said clearly, meeting Watts rather startled gaze.Doesnt dare let you exchange three words with me, for fear Ill letsomething slip. No wonder hes trying to put me out of here--hesskating on thin ice these days.Goaded, St. Cyr rolled forward in a ponderous lunge, but Wattinterposed. It was true, of course, that the writer was probably tryingto break his contract. But there were wheels within wheels here. Martinwas too confident, too debonaire. Something was going on which Watt didnot understand.All right, Raoul, he said decisively. Relax for a minute. I saidrelax! We dont want Nick here suing you for assault and battery, do we?Your artistic temperament carries you away sometimes. Relax and letshear what Nick has to say.Watch out for him, Tolliver! St. Cyr cried warningly. Theyrecunning, these creatures. Cunning as rats. You never know--Martin raised the microphone with a lordly gesture. Ignoring thedirector, he said commandingly into the mike, Put me through to thecommissary. The bar, please. Yes. I want to order a drink. Somethingvery special. A--ah--a Helena Glinska--        *        *       *        *        *Hello, Erika Ashbys voice said from the door. Nick, are you there?May I come in?The sound of her voice sent delicious chills rushing up and downMartins spine. He swung round, mike in hand, to welcome her. But St.Cyr, pleased at this diversion, roared before he could speak.No, no, no, no! Go! Go at once. Whoever you are--_out_!Erika, looking very brisk, attractive and firm, marched into the roomand cast at Martin a look of resigned patience.Very clearly she expected to fight both her own battles and his.Im on business here, she told St. Cyr coldly. You cant part authorand agent like this. Nick and I want to have a word with Mr. Watt.Ah, my pretty creature, sit down, Martin said in a loud, clear voice,scrambling out of his chair. Welcome! Im just ordering myself a drink.Will you have something?Erika looked at him with startled suspicion. No, and neither will you,she said. How many have you had already? Nick, if youre drunk at atime like this--And no shilly-shallying, Martin said blandly into the mike. I want itat once, do you hear? A Helena Glinska, yes. Perhaps you dont know it?Then listen carefully. Take the largest Napoleon youve got. If youhavent a big one, a small punch bowl will do. Fill it half full withice-cold ale. Got that? Add three jiggers of creme de menthe--Nick, are you mad? Erika demanded, revolted.--and six jiggers of honey, Martin went on placidly. Stir, dontshake. Never shake a Helena Glinska. Keep it well chilled, and--Miss Ashby, we are very busy, St. Cyr broke in importantly, makingshooing motions toward the door. Not now. Sorry. You interrupt. Go atonce.--better add six more jiggers of honey, Martin was heard to addcontemplatively into the mike. And then send it over immediately. Dropeverything else, and get it here within sixty seconds. Theres a bonusfor you if you do. Okay? Good. See to it.He tossed the microphone casually at St. Cyr.Meanwhile, Erika had closed in on Tolliver Watt.Ive just come from talking to Gloria Eden, she said, and sheswilling to do a one-picture deal with Summit _if_ I okay it. But Im notgoing to okay it unless you release Nick Martin from his contract, andthats flat.Watt showed pleased surprise.Well, we might get together on that, he said instantly, for he was afan of Miss Edens and for a long time had yearned to star her in aremake of _Vanity Fair_. Why didnt you bring her along? We couldhave--Nonsense! St. Cyr shouted. Do not discuss this matter yet, Tolliver.Shes down at Laguna, Erika explained. Be quiet, St. Cyr! I wont--A knock at the door interrupted her. Martin hurried to open it and as hehad expected encountered a waiter with a tray.Quick work, he said urbanely, accepting the huge, coldly sweatingNapoleon in a bank of ice. Beautiful, isnt it?St. Cyrs booming shouts from behind him drowned out whatever remark thewaiter may have made as he received a bill from Martin and withdrew,looking nauseated.No, no, no, no, St. Cyr was roaring. Tolliver, we can get Gloria andkeep this writer too, not that he is any good, but I have spent alreadythirteen weeks training him in the St. Cyr approach. Leave it to me. InMixo-Lydia we handle--Erikas attractive mouth was opening and shutting, her voice unheard inthe uproar. St. Cyr could keep it up indefinitely, as was well known inHollywood. Martin sighed, lifted the brimming Napoleon and sniffeddelicately as he stepped backward toward his chair. When his heeltouched it, he tripped with the utmost grace and savoir-faire, and verydeftly emptied the Helena Glinsak, ale, honey, creme de menthe, ice andall, over St. Cyrs capacious front.St. Cyrs bellow broke the microphone.        *        *       *        *        *Martin had composed his invention carefully. The nauseous brew combinedthe maximum elements of wetness, coldness, stickiness and pungency.The drenched St. Cyr, shuddering violently as the icy beverage delugedhis legs, snatched out his handkerchief and mopped in vain. Thehandkerchief merely stuck to his trousers, glued there by twelve jiggersof honey. He reeked of peppermint.I suggest we adjourn to the commissary, Martin said fastidiously. Insome private booth we can go on with this discussion away from the--therather overpowering smell of peppermint.In Mixo-Lydia, St. Cyr gasped, sloshing in his shoes as he turnedtoward Martin, in Mixo-Lydia we throw to the dogs--we boil inoil--we--And next time, Martin said, please dont joggle my elbow when Imholding a Helena Glinska. Its most annoying.St. Cyr drew a mighty breath, rose to his full height--and thensubsided. St. Cyr at the moment looked like a Keystone Kop after thechase sequence, and knew it. Even if he killed Martin now, the elementof classic tragedy would be lacking. He would appear in the untenableposition of Hamlet murdering his uncle with custard pies.Do nothing until I return! he commanded, and with a final glare atMartin plunged moistly out of the theater.The door crashed shut behind him. There was silence for a moment exceptfor the soft music from the overhead screen which DeeDee had caused tobe turned on again, so that she might watch her own lovely form flickerin dimmed images through pastel waves, while she sang a duet with DanDailey about sailors, mermaids and her home in far Atlantis.And now, said Martin, turning with quiet authority to Watt, who wasregarding him with a baffled expression, I want a word with you.I cant discuss your contract till Raoul gets back, Watt said quickly.Nonsense, Martin said in a firm voice. Why should St. Cyr dictateyour decisions? Without you, he couldnt turn out a box-office successif he had to. No, be quiet, Erika. Im handling this, my prettycreature.Watt rose to his feet. Sorry, I cant discuss it, he said. St. Cyrpictures make money, and youre an inexperien--Thats why I see the true situation so clearly, Martin said. Thetrouble with you is you draw a line between artistic genius andfinancial genius. To you, its merely routine when you work with theplastic medium of human minds, shaping them into an Ideal Audience. Youare an ecological genius, Tolliver Watt! The true artist controls hisenvironment, and gradually you, with a masters consummate skill, shapethat great mass of living, breathing humanity into a perfectaudience....Sorry, Watt said, but not, bruskly. I really have no time--ah--Your genius has gone long enough unrecognized, Martin said hastily,letting admiration ring in his golden voice. You assume that St. Cyr isyour equal. You give him your own credit titles. Yet in your own mindyou must have known that half the credit for his pictures is yours. WasPhidias non-commercial? Was Michaelangelo? Commercialism is simply alabel for functionalism, and all great artists produce functional art.The trivial details of Rubens masterpieces were filled in byassistants, were they not? But Rubens got the credit, not his hirelings.The proof of the puddings obvious. Why? Cunningly gauging hislistener, Martin here broke off.Why? Watt asked.Sit down, Martin urged. Ill tell you why. St. Cyrs pictures makemoney, but youre responsible for their molding into the ideal form,impressing your character-matrix upon everything and everyone at SummitStudios....        *        *       *        *        *Slowly Watt sank into his chair. About his ears the hypnotic bursts ofDisraelian rhodomontade thundered compellingly. For Martin had the manhooked. With unerring aim he had at the first try discovered Wattsweakness--the uncomfortable feeling in a professionally arty town thatmoney-making is a basically contemptible business. Disraeli had handledtougher problems in his day. He had swayed Parliaments.Watt swayed, tottered--and fell. It took about ten minutes, all in all.By the end of that time, dizzy with eloquent praise of his economicability, Watt had realized that while St. Cyr might be an artisticgenius, he had no business interfering in the plans of an economicgenius. Nobody told Watt what to do when economics were concerned.You have the broad vision that can balance all possibilities and showthe right path with perfect clarity, Martin said glibly. Very well.You wish Eden. You feel--do you not?--that I am unsuitable material.Only geniuses can change their plans with instantaneous speed.... Whenwill my contract release be ready?What? said Watt, in a swimming, glorious daze. Oh. Of course. Hm-m.Your contract release. Well, now--St. Cyr would stubbornly cling to past errors until Summit goes broke,Martin pointed out. Only a genius like Tolliver Watt strikes when theiron is hot, when he sees a chance to exchange failure for success, aMartin for an Eden.Hm-m, Watt said. Yes. Very well, then. His long face grew shrewd.Very, well, you get your release--_after_ Ive signed Eden.There you put your finger on the heart of the matter, Martin approved,after a very brief moment of somewhat dashed thought. Miss Eden isstill undecided. If you left the transaction to somebody like St. Cyr,say, it would be botched. Erika, you have your car here? How quicklycould you drive Tolliver Watt to Laguna? Hes the only person with theskill to handle this situation.What situa--oh, yes. Of course, Nick. We could start right away.But-- Watt said.The Disraeli-matrix swept on into oratorical periods that made the wallsring. The golden tongue played arpeggios with logic.I see, the dazed Watt murmured, allowing himself to be shepherdedtoward the door. Yes, yes, of course. Then--suppose you drop over to myplace tonight, Martin. After I get the Eden signature, Ill have yourrelease prepared. Hm-m. Functional genius.... His voice fell to a low,crooning mutter, and he moved quietly out of the door.Martin laid a hand on Erikas arm as she followed him.Wait a second, he said. Keep him away from the studio until we getthe release. St. Cyr can still out-shout me any time. But hes hooked.We--Nick, Erika said, looking searchingly into his face. Whatshappened?Tell you tonight, Martin said hastily, hearing a distant bellow thatmight be the voice of St. Cyr approaching. When I have time Im goingto sweep you off your feet. Did you know that Ive worshipped you fromafar all my life? But right now, get Watt out of the way. Hurry!Erika cast a glance of amazed bewilderment at him as he thrust her outof the door. Martin thought there was a certain element of pleasure inthe surprise.        *        *       *        *        *Where is Tolliver? The loud, annoyed roar of St. Cyr made Martinwince. The director was displeased, it appeared, because only inCostumes could a pair of trousers be found large enough to fit him. Hetook it as a personal affront. What have you done with Tolliver? hebellowed.Louder, please, Martin said insolently. I cant hear you.DeeDee, St. Cyr shouted, whirling toward the lovely star, who hadntstirred from her rapturous admiration of DeeDee in technicolor overhead.Where is Tolliver?Martin started. He had quite forgotten DeeDee.You dont know, do you, DeeDee? he prompted quickly.Shut up, St. Cyr snapped. Answer me, you-- He added a briskpolysyllable in Mixo-Lydian, with the desired effect. DeeDee wrinkledher flawless brow.Tolliver went away, I think. Ive got it mixed up with the picture. Hewent home to meet Nick Martin, didnt he?See? Martin interrupted, relieved. No use expecting DeeDee to--But Martin is _here_! St. Cyr shouted. Think, think!Was the contract release in the rushes? DeeDee asked vaguely.A contract release? St. Cyr roared. What is this? Never will I permitit, never, never, never! DeeDee, answer me--where has Watt gone?He went somewhere with that agent, DeeDee said. Or was that in therushes too?But where, where, where?They went to Atlantis, DeeDee announced with an air of faint triumph.No! shouted St. Cyr. That was the _picture_! The mermaid came fromAtlantis, not Watt!Tolliver didnt say he was coming from Atlantis, DeeDee murmured,unruffled. He said he was going to Atlantis. Then he was going to meetNick Martin at his house tonight and give him his contract release.When? St. Cyr demanded furiously. Think, DeeDee? What time did--DeeDee, Martin said, stepping forward with suave confidence, youcant remember a thing, can you? But DeeDee was too subnormal to reacteven to a Disraeli-matrix. She merely smiled placidly at him.Out of my way, you writer! roared St. Cyr, advancing upon Martin. Youwill get no contract release! You do not waste St. Cyrs time and getaway with it! This I will not endure. I fix you as I fixed Ed Cassidy!Martin drew himself up and froze St. Cyr with an insolent smile. Hishand toyed with an imaginary monocle. Golden periods were hanging at theend of his tongue. There only remained to hypnotize St. Cyr as he hadhypnotized Watt. He drew a deep breath to unlease the floods of hiseloquence--And St. Cyr, also too subhuman to be impressed by urbanity, hit Martin aclout on the jaw.It could never have happened in the British Parliament.IIIWhen the robot walked into Martins office that evening, he, or it, wentdirectly to the desk, unscrewed the bulb from the lamp, pressed theswitch, and stuck his finger into the socket. There was a cracklingflash. ENIAC withdrew his finger and shook his metallic head violently.I needed that, he sighed. Ive been on the go all day, by theKaldekooz time-scale. Paleolithic, Neolithic, Technological--I donteven know what time it is. Well, hows your ecological adjustmentgetting on?Martin rubbed his chin thoughtfully.Badly, he said. Tell me, did Disraeli, as Prime Minister, ever haveany dealings with a country called Mixo-Lydia?I have no idea, said the robot. Why do you ask?Because my environment hauled back and took a poke at my jaw, Martinsaid shortly.Then you provoked it, ENIAC countered. A crisis--a situation ofstress--always brings a mans dominant trait to the fore, and Disraeliwas dominantly courageous. Under stress, his courage became insolence.But he was intelligent enough to arrange his environment so insolencewould be countered on the semantic level. Mixo-Lydia, eh? I place itvaguely, some billions of years ago, when it was inhabited by giantwhite apes. Or--oh, now I remember. Its an encysted medieval survival,isnt it?Martin nodded.So is this movie studio, the robot said. Your trouble is that youverun up against somebody whos got a better optimum ecological adjustmentthan you have. Thats it. This studio environment is just emerging frommedievalism, so it can easily slip back into that plenum when an optimummedievalist exerts pressure. Such types caused the Dark Ages. Well,youd better change your environment to a neo-technological one, wherethe Disraeli matrix can be successfully pro-survival. In your era, onlya few archaic social-encystments like this studio are feudalistic, so gosomewhere else. It takes a feudalist to match a feudalist.But I cant go somewhere else, Martin complained. Not without mycontract release. I was supposed to pick it up tonight, but St. Cyrfound out what was happening, and hell throw a monkey-wrench in theworks if he has to knock me out again to do it. Im due at Watts placenow, but St. Cyrs already there--Spare me the trivia, the robot said, raising his hand. As for thisSt. Cyr, if hes a medieval character-type, obviously hell knuckleunder only to a stronger man of his own kind.How would Disraeli have handled this? Martin demanded.Disraeli would never have got into such a situation in the firstplace, the robot said unhelpfully. The ecologizer can give you theideal ecological differential, but only for your own type, becauseotherwise it wouldnt be your optimum. Disraeli would have been afailure in Russia in Ivans time.Would you mind clarifying that? Martin asked thoughtfully.Certainly, the robot said with great rapidity. It all depends on thethreshold-response-time of the memory-circuits in the brain, if youassume the identity of the basic chromosome-pattern. The strength ofneuronic activation varies in inverse proportion to the quantativememory factor. Only actual experience could give you Disraelismemories, but your reactivity-thresholds have been altered untilperception and emotional-indices approximate the Disraeli ratio.Oh, Martin said. But how would _you_, say, assert yourself against amedieval steam-shovel?By plugging my demountable brain into a larger steam-shovel, ENIACtold him.        *        *       *        *        *Martin seemed pensive. His hand rose, adjusting an invisible monocle,while a look of perceptive imagination suddenly crossed his face.You mentioned Russia in Ivans time, he said. Which Ivan would thatbe? Not, by any chance--?Ivan the Fourth. Very well adjusted to his environment he was, too.However, enough of this chit-chat. Obviously youll be one of thefailures in our experiment, but our aim is to strike an average, so ifyoull put the ecologizer on your--That was Ivan the Terrible, wasnt it? Martin interrupted. Look here,could you impress the character-matrix of Ivan the Terrible on mybrain?That wouldnt help you a bit, the robot said. Besides, its not thepurpose of the experiment. Now--One moment. Disraeli cant cope with a medievalist like St. Cyr on hisown level, but if I had Ivan the Terribles reactive thresholds, Illbet I could throw a bluff that might do the trick. Even though St. Cyrsbigger than I am, hes got a veneer of civilization ... now wait. Hetrades on that. Hes always dealt with people who are too civilized touse his own methods. The trick would be to call his bluff. And Ivansthe man who could do it.But you dont understand.Didnt everybody in Russia tremble with fear at Ivans name?Yes, in--Very well, then, Martin said triumphantly. Youre going to impressthe character-matrix, of Ivan the Terrible on my mind, and then Imgoing to put the bite on St. Cyr, the way Ivan would have done it.Disraelis simply too civilized. Size is a factor, but characters moreimportant. I dont _look_ like Disraeli, but people have been reactingto me as though I were George Arliss down to the spit-curl. A good bigman can always lick a good little man. But St. Cyrs never been upagainst a really uncivilized little man--one whod gladly rip out anenemys heart with his bare hands. Martin nodded briskly. St. Cyr willback down--Ive found that out. But it would take somebody like Ivan tomake him stay all the way down.If you think Im going to impress Ivans matrix on you, youre wrong,the robot said.You couldnt be talked into it?I, said ENIAC, am a robot, semantically adjusted. Of course youcouldnt talk me into it.Perhaps not, Martin reflected, but Disraeli--hm-m. Man is a machine.Why, Disraeli was the one person in the world ideally fitted forrobot-coercion. To him, men _were_ machines--and what was ENIAC?Lets talk this over-- Martin began, absently pushing the desk-lamptoward the robot. And then the golden tongue that had swayed empires wasloosed....Youre not going to like this, the robot said dazedly, sometime later.Ivan wont do at ... oh, youve got me all confused. Youll have toeyeprint a-- He began to pull out of his sack the helmet and thequarter-mile of red ribbon.To tie up my bonny grey brain, Martin said, drunk with his ownrhetoric. Put it on my head. Thats right. Ivan the Terrible, remember.Ill fix St. Cyrs Mixo-Lydian wagon.Differential depends on environment as much as on heredity, the robotmuttered, clapping the helmet on Martins head. Though naturally Ivanwouldnt have had the Tsardom environment without his particularheredity, involving Helena Glinska--there! He removed the helmet.But nothings happening, Martin said. I dont feel any different.Itll take a few moments. This isnt your basic character-pattern,remember, as Disraelis was. Enjoy yourself while you can. Youll getthe Ivan-effect soon enough. He shouldered the sack and headeduncertainly for the door.Wait, Martin said uneasily. Are you sure--Be quiet. I forgot something--some formality--now Im all confused.Well, Ill think of it later, or earlier, as the case may be. Ill seeyou in twelve hours--I hope.The robot departed. Martin shook his head tentatively from side to side.Then he got up and followed ENIAC to the door. But there was no sign ofthe robot, except for a diminishing whirlwind of dust in the middle ofthe corridor._Something began to happen in Martins brain...._Behind him, the telephone rang.Martin heard himself gasp with pure terror. With a sudden, impossible,terrifying, absolute certainty he _knew_ who was telephoning._Assassins!_        *        *       *        *        *Yes, Mr. Martin, said Tolliver Watts butler to the telephone. MissAshby is here. She is with Mr. Watt and Mr. St. Cyr at the moment, but Iwill give her your message. You are detained. And she is to call foryou--where?The broom-closet on the second floor of the Writers Building, Martinsaid in a quavering voice. Its the only one near a telephone with along enough cord so I could take the phone in here with me. But Im notat all certain that Im safe. I dont like the looks of that broom on myleft.Sir?Are you _sure_ youre Tolliver Watts butler? Martin demandednervously.Quite sure, Mr.--eh--Mr. Martin.I _am_ Mr. Martin, cried Martin with terrified defiance. By all thelaws of God and man, Mr. Martin I am and Mr. Martin I will remain, inspite of all attempts by rebellious dogs to depose me from my rightfulplace.Yes, sir. The broom-closet, you say, sir?The broom-closet. Immediately. But swear not to tell another soul, nomatter how much youre threatened. Ill protect you.Very well, sir. Is that all?Yes. Tell Miss Ashby to hurry. Hang up now. The line may be tapped. Ihave enemies.There was a click. Martin replaced his own receiver and furtivelysurveyed the broom-closet. He told himself that this was ridiculous.There was nothing to be afraid of, was there? True, the broom-closetsnarrow walls were closing in upon him alarmingly, while the ceilingdescended....Panic-stricken, Martin emerged from the closet, took a long breath, andthrew back his shoulders. N-not a thing to be afraid of, he said.Whos afraid? Whistling, he began to stroll down the hall toward thestaircase, but midway agoraphobia overcame him, and his nerve broke.He ducked into his own office and sweated quietly in the dark until hehad mustered up enough courage to turn on a lamp.The Encyclopedia Britannica, in its glass-fronted cabinet, caught hiseye. With noiseless haste, Martin secured _ITALY_ to _LORD_ and openedthe volume at his desk. Something, obviously, was very, very wrong. Therobot had said that Martin wasnt going to like being Ivan the Terrible,come to think of it. But was Martin wearing Ivans character-matrix?Perhaps hed got somebody elses matrix by mistake--that of some arrantcoward. Or maybe the Mad Tsar of Russia had really been called Ivan theTerrified. Martin flipped the rustling pages nervously. Ivan, Ivan--hereit was.Son of Helena Glinska ... married Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina ...private life unspeakably abominable ... memory astonishing, energyindefatigable, ungovernable fury--great natural ability, politicalforesight, anticipated the ideals of Peter the Great--Martin shook hishead.Then he caught his breath at the next line.Ivan had lived in an atmosphere of apprehension, imagining that everymans hand was against him.Just like me, Martin murmured. But--but there was more to Ivan thanjust cowardice. I dont understand.Differential, the robot had said, depends on environment as much ason heredity. Though naturally Ivan wouldnt have had the Tsardomenvironment without his particular heredity.Martin sucked in his breath sharply. Environment does make a difference.No doubt Ivan IV had been a fearful coward, but heredity plusenvironment had given Ivan the one great weapon that had enabled him tokeep his cowardice a recessive trait.Ivan the Terrible had been Tsar of all the Russias.Give a coward a gun, and, while he doesnt stop being a coward, it wontshow in the same way. He may act like a violent, aggressive tyrantinstead. That, of course, was why Ivan had been ecologicallysuccessful--in his specialized environment. Hed never run up againstmany stresses that brought his dominant trait to the fore. LikeDisraeli, he had been able to control his environment so that suchstresses were practically eliminated.Martin turned green.Then he remembered Erika. Could he get Erika to keep St. Cyr busy,somehow, while he got his contract release from Watt? As long as hecould avoid crises, he could keep his nerve from crumbling, but--_therewere assassins everywhere_!Erika was on her way to the lot by now. Martin swallowed.He would meet her outside the studio. The broom-closet wasnt safe. Hecould be trapped there like a rat--Nonsense, Martin told himself with shivering firmness. This isnt me.All I have to do is get a g-grip on m-myself. Come, now. Buck up._Toujours laudace!_But he went out of his office and downstairs very softly and cautiously.After all, one never knew. And when every mans hand was against one....Quaking, the character-matrix of Ivan the Terrible stole toward a studiogate.        *        *       *        *        *The taxi drove rapidly toward Bel-Air.But what were you doing up that tree? Erika demanded.Martin shook violently.A werewolf, he chattered. And a vampire and a ghoul and--I _saw_them, I tell you. There I was at the studio gate, and they all came atme in a mob.But they were just coming back from dinner, Erika said. You knowSummits doing night shooting on _Abbott and Costello Meet Everybody_.Karloff wouldnt hurt a fly.I kept telling myself that, Martin said dully, but I was out of mymind with guilt and fear. You see, Im an abominable monster. But itsnot my fault. Its environmental. I grew up in brutal and degradingconditions--oh, look! He pointed toward a traffic cop ahead. Thepolice! Traitors even in the palace guards!Lady, is that guy nuts? the cabbie demanded.Mad or sane, I am Nicholas Martin, Martin announced, with an abruptvolte face. He tried to stand up commandingly, bumped his head, screamed_Assassins!_ and burrowed into a corner of the seat, panting horribly.Erika gave him a thoughtful, worried look.Nick, she said, How much have you had to drink? Whats wrong?Martin shut his eyes and lay back against the cushions.Let me have a few minutes, Erika, he pleaded. Ill be all right assoon as I recover from stress. Its only when Im under stress thatIvan--You can accept your contract release from Watt, cant you? Surelyyoull be able to manage that.Of course, Martin said with feeble bravery. He thought it over andreconsidered. If I can hold your hand, he suggested, taking nochances.This disgusted Erika so much that for two miles there was no moreconversation within the cab.Erika had been thinking her own thoughts.Youve certainly changed since this morning, she observed.Threatening to make love to me, of all things. As if Id stand for it.Id like to see you try. There was a pause. Erika slid her eyessidewise toward Martin. I said Id like to see you try, she repeated.Oh, you would, would you? Martin said with hollow valor. He paused.Oddly enough his tongue, hitherto frozen stiff on one particular subjectin Erikas presence, was now thoroughly loosened. Martin wasted no timeon theory. Seizing his chance before a new stress might unexpectedlyarise, he instantly poured out his heart to Erika, who visibly softened.But why didnt you ever say so before? she asked.I cant imagine, Martin said. Then youll marry me?But why were you acting so--Will you marry me?Yes, Erika said, and there was a pause. Martin moistened his lips,discovering that somehow he and Erika had moved close together. He wasabout to seal the bargain in the customary manner when a sudden thoughtstruck him and made him draw back with a little start.Erika opened her eyes.Ah-- said Martin. Um. I just happened to remember. Theres a bad fluepidemic in Chicago. Epidemics spread like wildfire, you know. Why, itcould be in Hollywood by now--especially with the prevailing westerlywinds.Im damned if Im going to be proposed to and not kissed, Erika saidin a somewhat irritated tone. You kiss me!But I might give you bubonic plague, Martin said nervously. Kissingspreads germs. Its a well-known fact.Nick!Well--I dont know--when did you last have a cold?Erika pulled away from him and went to sit in the other corner.Ah, Martin said, after a long silence. Erika?Dont talk to me, you miserable man, Erika said. You monster, you.I cant help it, Martin cried wildly. Ill be a coward for twelvehours. Its not my fault. After eight tomorrow morning Ill--Ill walkinto a lion-cage if you want, but tonight Im as yellow as Ivan theTerrible! At least let me tell you whats been happening.Erika said nothing. Martin instantly plunged into his long andimprobable tale.I dont believe a word of it, Erika said, when he had finished. Sheshook her head sharply. Just the same, Im still your agent, and yourcareers still my responsibility. The first and only thing we have to dois get your contract release from Tolliver Watt. And thats _all_ weregoing to consider right now, do you hear?But St. Cyr--Ill do all the talking. You wont have to say a word. If St. Cyr triesto bully you, Ill handle him. But youve got to be there with me, orSt. Cyr will make that an excuse to postpone things again. I know him.Now Im under stress again, Martin said wildly. I cant stand it._Im_ not the Tsar of Russia.Lady, said the cab-driver, looking back, if I was you, Id sure ashell break off that engagement.Heads will roll for this, Martin said ominously.        *        *       *        *        *By mutual consent, agree to terminate ... yes, Watt said, affixing hisname to the legal paper that lay before him on the desk. That does it.But where in the world is that fellow Martin? He came in with you, Imcertain.Did he? Erika asked, rather wildly. She too, was wondering how Martinhad managed to vanish so miraculously from her side. Perhaps he hadcrept with lightning rapidity under the carpet. She forced her mind fromthe thought and reached for the contract release Watt was folding.Wait, St. Cyr said, his lower lip jutting. What about a clause givingus an option on Martins next play?Watt paused, and the director instantly struck home.Whatever it may be, I can turn it into a vehicle for DeeDee, eh,DeeDee? He lifted a sausage finger at the lovely star, who noddedobediently.Its going to have an all-male cast, Erika said hastily. And werediscussing contract releases, not options.He would give me an option if I had him here, St. Cyr growled,torturing his cigar horribly. Why does everything conspire against anartist? He waved a vast, hairy fist in the air. Now I must break in anew writer, which is a great waste. Within a fortnight Martin would havebeen a St. Cyr writer. In fact, it is still possible.Im afraid not, Raoul, Watt said resignedly. You really shouldnthave hit Martin at the studio today.But--but he would not dare charge me with assault. In Mixo-Lydia--Why, hello, Nick, DeeDee said, with a bright smile. What are youhiding behind those curtains for?Every eye was turned toward the window draperies, just in time to seethe white, terrified face of Nicholas Martin flip out of sight like ascared chipmunks. Erika, her heart dropping, said hastily, Oh, thatisnt Nick. It doesnt look a bit like him. You made a mistake, DeeDee.Did I? DeeDee asked, perfectly willing to agree.Certainly, Erika said, reaching for the contract release in Wattshand. Now if youll just let me have this, Ill--Stop! cried St. Cyr in a bulls bellow. Head sunk between his heavyshoulders, he lumbered to the window and jerked the curtains aside.Ha! the director said in a sinister voice. Martin.Its a lie, Martin said feebly, making a desperate attempt to concealhis stress-triggered panic. Ive abdicated.St. Cyr, who had stepped back a pace, was studying Martin carefully.Slowly the cigar in his mouth began to tilt upwards. An unpleasant grinwidened the directors mouth.He shook a finger under Martins quivering nostrils.You! he said. Tonight it is a different tune, eh? Today you weredrunk. Now I see it all. Valorous with pots, like they say.Nonsense, Martin said, rallying his courage by a glance at Erika. Whosay? Nobody but you would say a thing like that. Now whats this allabout?What were you doing behind that curtain? Watt asked._I_ wasnt behind the curtain, Martin said, with great bravado. _You_were. All of you. I was in front of the curtain. Can I help it if thewhole lot of you conceal yourselves behind curtains in a library,like--like conspirators? The word was unfortunately chosen. A panickylight flashed into Martins eyes. Yes, conspirators, he went onnervously. You think I dont know, eh? Well, I do. Youre allassassins, plotting and planning. So this is your headquarters, is it?All night your hired dogs have been at my heels, driving me like awounded caribou to--Weve got to be going, Erika said desperately. Theres just time tocatch the next carib--the next plane east. She reached for the contractrelease, but Watt suddenly put it in his pocket. He turned his chairtoward Martin.Will you give us an option on your next play? he demanded.Of course he will give us an option! St. Cyr said, studying Martinsair of bravado with an experienced eye. Also, there is to be noquestion of a charge of assault, for, if there is I will beat you. So itis in Mixo-Lydia. In fact, you do not even want a release from yourcontract, Martin. It is all a mistake. I will turn you into a St. Cyrwriter, and all will be well. So. Now you will ask Tolliver to tear upthat release, will you not--_ha_?Of course you wont, Nick, Erika cried. Say so!        *        *       *        *        *There was a pregnant silence. Watt watched with sharp interest. So didthe unhappy Erika, torn between her responsibility as Martins agent andher disgust at the mans abject cowardice. DeeDee watched too, her eyesvery wide and a cheerful smile upon her handsome face. But the battlewas obviously between Martin and Raoul St. Cyr.Martin drew himself up desperately. Now or never he must force himselfto be truly Terrible. Already he had a troubled expression, just likeIvan. He strove to look sinister too. An enigmatic smile played aroundhis lips. For an instant he resembled the Mad Tsar of Russia, except, ofcourse, that he was clean-shaven. With contemptuous, regal power Martinstared down the Mixo-Lydian.You will tear up that release and sign an agreement giving us option onyour next play too, ha? St. Cyr said--but a trifle uncertainly.Ill do as I please, Martin told him. How would you like to be eatenalive by dogs?I dont know, Raoul, Watt said. Lets try to get this settled evenif--Do you want me to go over to Metro and take DeeDee with me? St. Cyrcried, turning toward Watt. He _will_ sign! And, reaching into aninner pocket for a pen, the burly director swung back toward Martin._Assassin!_ cried Martin, misinterpreting the gesture.A gloating smile appeared on St. Cyrs revolting features.Now we have him, Tolliver, he said, with heavy triumph, and theseominous words added the final stress to Martins overwhelming burden.With a mad cry he rushed past St. Cyr, wrenched open a door, and fled.From behind him came Erikas Valkyrie voice.Leave him alone! Havent you done enough already? Now Im going to getthat contract release from you before I leave this room, Tolliver Watt,and I warn you, St. Cyr, if you--But by then Martin was five rooms away, and the voice faded. He dartedon, hopelessly trying to make himself slow down and return to the sceneof battle. The pressure was too strong. Terror hurled him down acorridor, into another room, and against a metallic object from which herebounded, to find himself sitting on the floor looking up at ENIACGamma the Ninety-Third.Ah, there you are, the robot said. Ive been searching all overspace-time for you. You forgot to give me a waiver of responsibilitywhen you talked me into varying the experiment. The Authorities would bein my gears if I didnt bring back an eyeprinted waiver when a subjectsscratched by variance.With a frightened glance behind him, Martin rose to his feet.What? he asked confusedly. Listen, youve got to change me back tomyself. Everyones trying to kill me. Youre just in time. I cant waittwelve hours. Change me back to myself, quick!Oh, Im through with you, the robot said callously. Youre no longera suitably unconditioned subject, after that last treatment you insistedon. I should have got the waiver from you then, but you got me allconfused with Disraelis oratory. Now here. Just hold this up to yourleft eye for twenty seconds. He extended a flat, glittering littlemetal disk. Its already sensitized and filled out. It only needs youreyeprint. Affix it, and youll never see me again.Martin shrank away.But whats going to happen to me? he quavered, swallowing.How should I know? After twelve hours, the treatment will wear off, andyoull be yourself again. Hold this up to your eye, now.I will if youll change me back to myself, Martin haggled.I cant. Its against the rules. One variance is bad enough, even witha filed waiver, but two? Oh, no. Hold this up to your left eye--No, Martin said with feeble firmness. I wont.ENIAC studied him.Yes, you will, the robot said finally, or Ill go boo at you.Martin paled slightly, but he shook his head in desperate determination.No, he said doggedly. Unless I get rid of Ivans matrix right now,Erika will never marry me and Ill never get my contract release fromWatt. All you have to do is put that helmet on my head and change meback to myself. Is that too much to ask?Certainly, of a robot, ENIAC said stiffly. No more shilly-shallying.Its lucky you are wearing the Ivan-matrix, so I can impose my will onyou. Put your eyeprint on this. Instantly!Martin rushed behind the couch and hid. The robot advanced menacingly.And at that moment, pushed to the last ditch, Martin suddenly rememberedsomething.He faced the robot.        *        *       *        *        *Wait, he said. You dont understand. I cant eyeprint that thing. Itwont work on me. Dont you realize that? Its supposed to take theeyeprint----of the rod-and-cone pattern of the retina, the robot said. So--So how can it do that unless I can keep my eye open for twenty seconds?My perceptive reaction-thresholds are Ivans arent they? I cantcontrol the reflex of blinking. Ive got a cowards synapses. And theydforce me to shut my eyes tight the second that gimmick got too close tothem.Hold them open, the robot suggested. With your fingers.My fingers have reflexes too, Martin argued, moving toward asideboard. Theres only one answer. Ive got to get drunk. If Im halfstupefied with liquor, my reflexes will be so slow I wont be able toshut my eyes. And dont try to use force, either. If I dropped dead withfear, how could you get my eyeprint then?Very easily, the robot said. Id pry open your lids--Martin hastily reached for a bottle on the sideboard, and a glass. Buthis hand swerved aside and gripped, instead, a siphon of soda water.--only, ENIAC went on, the forgery might be detected.Martin fizzled the glass full of soda and took a long drink.I wont be long getting drunk, he said, his voice thickening. Infact, its beginning to work already. See? Im coöperating.The robot hesitated.Well, hurry up about it, he said, and sat down.Martin, about to take another drink, suddenly paused, staring at ENIAC.Then, with a sharply indrawn breath, he lowered the glass.Whats the matter now? the robot asked. Drink your--what is it?Its whiskey, Martin told the inexperienced automaton, but now I seeit all. Youve put poison in it. So thats your plan, is it? Well, Iwont touch another drop, and now youll never get my eyeprint. Im nofool.Cog Almighty, the robot said, rising. You poured that drink yourself.How could I have poisoned it? Drink!I wont, Martin said, with a cowards stubbornness, fighting back thegrowing suspicion that the drink might really be toxic.You swallow that drink, ENIAC commanded, his voice beginning to quiverslightly. Its perfectly harmless.Then prove it! Martin said cunningly. Would you be willing to switchglasses? Would you drink this poisoned brew yourself?How do you expect me to drink? the robot demanded. I-- He paused.All right, hand me the glass, he said. Ill take a sip. Then youvegot to drink the rest of it.Aha! Martin said. You betrayed yourself that time. Youre a robot.You cant drink, remember? Not the same way that I can, anyhow. Now Ivegot you trapped, you assassin. _Theres_ your brew. He pointed to afloor-lamp. Do you dare to drink with me now, in your electricalfashion, or do you admit you are trying to poison me? Wait a minute,what am I saying? That wouldnt prove a--Of course it would, the robot said hastily. Youre perfectly right,and its very cunning of you. Well drink together, and that will proveyour whiskeys harmless--so youll keep on drinking till your reflexesslow down, see?Well, Martin began uncertainly, but the unscrupulous robot unscrewed abulb from the floor lamp, pulled the switch, and inserted his fingerinto the empty socket, which caused a crackling flash. There, therobot said. It isnt poisoned, see?Youre not swallowing it, Martin said suspiciously. Youre holding itin your mouth--I mean your finger.ENIAC again probed the socket.Well, all right, perhaps, Martin said, in a doubtful fashion. But Imnot going to risk your slipping a powder in my liquor, you traitor.Youre going to keep up with me, drink for drink, until I can eyeprintthat gimmick of yours--or else I stop drinking. But does sticking yourfinger in that lamp really prove my liquor isnt poisoned? I cantquite--Of course it does, the robot said quickly. Ill prove it. Ill do itagain ... _f(t)_. Powerful DC, isnt it? Certainly it proves it. Keepdrinking, now.        *        *       *        *        *His gaze watchfully on the robot, Martin lifted his glass of club soda._F ff ff f(t)!_ cried the robot, some time later, sketching asingularly loose smile on its metallic face.Best fermented mammoths milk I ever tasted, Martin agreed, liftinghis tenth glass of soda-water. He felt slightly queasy and wondered ifhe might be drowning.Mammoths milk? asked ENIAC thickly. What year is this?Martin drew a long breath. Ivans capacious memory had served him verywell so far. Voltage, he recalled, increased the frequency of therobots thought-patterns and disorganized ENIACs memory--which wasbeing proved before his eyes. But the crux of his plan was yet tocome....The year of the great Hairy One, of course, Martin said briskly.Dont you remember?Then you-- ENIAC strove to focus upon his drinking-companion. Youmust be Mammoth-Slayer.Thats it! Martin cried. Have another jolt. What about giving me thetreatment now?What treatment?Martin looked impatient. You said you were going to impose thecharacter-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer on my mind. You said _that_ wouldinsure my optimum ecological adjustment in this temporal phase, andnothing else would.Did I? But youre not Mammoth-Slayer, ENIAC said confusedly.Mammoth-Slayer was the son of the Great Hairy One. Whats your mothersname?The Great Hairy One, Martin replied, at which the robot grated itshand across its gleaming forehead.Have one more jolt, Martin suggested. Now take out the ecologizer andput it on my head.Like this? ENIAC asked, obeying. I keep feeling Ive forgottensomething important. _F (t)._Martin adjusted the crystal helmet on his skull. Now, he commanded.Give me the character-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer, son of the Great HairyOne.Well--all right, ENIAC said dizzily. The red ribbons swirled. Therewas a flash from the helmet. There, the robot said. Its done. It maytake a few minutes to begin functioning, but then for twelve hoursyoull--wait! Where are you going?But Martin had already departed.The robot stuffed the helmet and the quarter-mile of red ribbon back forthe last time. He lurched to the floor-lamp, muttering something aboutone for the road. Afterward, the room lay empty. A fading murmur said,_F(t)._        *        *       *        *        *Nick! Erika gasped, staring at the figure in the doorway. Dont standlike that! You frighten me!Everyone in the room looked up abruptly at her cry, and so were just intime to see a horrifying change take place in Martins shape. It was anillusion, of course, but an alarming one. His knees slowly bent until hewas half-crouching, his shoulders slumped as though bowed by the weightof enormous back and shoulder muscles, and his arms swung forward untiltheir knuckles hung perilously near the floor.Nicholas Martin had at last achieved a personality whose ecological normwould put him on a level with Raoul St. Cyr.Nick! Erika quavered.Slowly Martins jaw protruded till his lower teeth were hideouslyvisible. Gradually his eyelids dropped until he was peering up out oftiny, wicked sockets. Then, slowly, a perfectly shocking grin broadenedMr. Martins mouth.Erika, he said throatily. Mine!And with that, he shambled forward, seized the horrified girl in hisarms, and bit her on the ear.Oh, Nick, Erika murmured, closing her eyes. Why didnt you ever--no,no, _no_! Nick! Stop it! The contract release. Weve got to--Nick, whatare you doing? She snatched at Martins departing form, but too late.For all his ungainly and unpleasant gait, Martin covered ground fast.Almost instantly he was clambering over Watts desk as the most directroute to that startled tycoon. DeeDee looked on, a little surprised. St.Cyr lunged forward.In Mixo-Lydia-- he began. Ha! So! He picked up Martin and threw himacross the room.Oh, you beast, Erika cried, and flung herself upon the director,beating at his brawny chest. On second thought, she used her shoes onhis shins with more effect. St. Cyr, no gentleman, turned her around,pinioned her arms behind her, and glanced up at Watts alarmed cry.Martin! What are you doing?There was reason for his inquiry. Apparently unhurt by St. Cyrs toss,Martin had hit the floor, rolled over and over like a ball, knocked downa floor-lamp with a crash, and uncurled, with an unpleasant expressionon his face. He rose crouching, bandy-legged, his arms swinging low, asnarl curling his lips.You take my mate? the pithecanthropic Mr. Martin inquired throatily,rapidly losing all touch with the twentieth century. It was a rhetoricalquestion. He picked up the lamp-standard--he did not have to bend to doit--tore off the silk shade as he would have peeled foliage from atree-limb, and balanced the weapon in his hand. Then he moved forward,carrying the lamp-standard like a spear.I, said Martin, kill.He then endeavored, with the most admirable single-heartedness, to carryout his expressed intention. The first thrust of the blunt, improvisedspear rammed into St. Cyrs solar plexus and drove him back against thewall with a booming thud. This seemed to be what Martin wanted. Keepingone end of his spear pressed into the directors belly, he crouchedlower, dug his toes into the rug, and did his very best to drill a holein St. Cyr.Stop it! cried Watt, flinging himself into the conflict. Ancientreflexes took over. Martins arm shot out. Watt shot off in the oppositedirection.The lamp broke.Martin looked pensively at the pieces, tentatively began to bite one,changed his mind, and looked at St. Cyr instead. The gasping director,mouthing threats, curses and objections, drew himself up, and shook ahuge fist at Martin.I, he announced, shall kill you with my bare hands. Then I go over toMGM with DeeDee. In Mixo-Lydia--Martin lifted his own fists toward his face. He regarded them. Heunclenched them slowly, while a terrible grin spread across his face.And then, with every tooth showing, and with the hungry gleam of a madtiger in his tiny little eyes, he lifted his gaze to St. Cyrs throat.Mammoth-Slayer was not the son of the Great Hairy One for nothing.        *        *       *        *        *Martin sprang.So did St. Cyr--in another direction, screaming with sudden terror. For,after all, he was only a medievalist. The feudal man is far morecivilized than the so-called man of Mammoth-Slayers primordially directera, and as a man recoils from a small but murderous wildcat, so St. Cyrfled in sudden civilized horror from an attacker who was, literally,afraid of nothing.He sprang through the window and, shrieking, vanished into the night.Martin was taken by surprise. When Mammoth-Slayer leaped at an enemy,the enemy leaped at him too, and so Martins head slammed against thewall with disconcerting force. Dimly he heard diminishing, terrifiedcries. Laboriously he crawled to his feet and set back against the wall,snarling, quite ready....Nick! Erikas voice called. Nick, its me! Stop it! _Stop it!_DeeDee--Ugh? Martin said thickly, shaking his head. Kill. He growled softly,blinking through red-rimmed little eyes at the scene around him. It swamback slowly into focus. Erika was struggling with DeeDee near thewindow.You let me go, DeeDee cried. Where Raoul goes, I go.DeeDee! pleaded a new voice. Martin glanced aside to see Tolliver Wattcrumpled in a corner, a crushed lamp-shade half obscuring his face.With a violent effort Martin straightened up. Walking upright seemedunnatural, somehow, but it helped submerge Mammoth-Slayers worstinstincts. Besides, with St. Cyr gone, stresses were slowly subsiding,so that Mammoth-Slayers dominant trait was receding from the activeforeground.Martin tested his tongue cautiously, relieved to find he was stillcapable of human speech.Uh, he said. Arrgh ... ah. Watt.Watt blinked at him anxiously through the lamp-shade.Urgh ... Ur--release, Martin said, with a violent effort. Contractrelease. Gimme.Watt had courage. He crawled to his feet, removing the lamp-shade.Contract release! he snapped. You madman! Dont you realize whatyouve done? DeeDees walking out on me. DeeDee, dont go. We will bringRaoul back--Raoul told me to quit if he quit, DeeDee said stubbornly.You dont have to do what St. Cyr tells you, Erika said, hanging ontothe struggling star.Dont I? DeeDee asked, astonished. Yes, I do. I always have.DeeDee, Watt said frantically, Ill give you the finest contract onearth--a ten-year contract--look, here it is. He tore out awell-creased document. All you have to do is sign, and you can haveanything you want. Wouldnt you like that?Oh, yes, DeeDee said. But Raoul wouldnt like it. She broke freefrom Erika.Martin! Watt told the playwright frantically, Get St. Cyr back.Apologize to him. I dont care how, but get him back! If you dont,I--Ill never give you your release.Martin was observed to slump slightly--perhaps with hopelessness. Then,again, perhaps not.Im sorry, DeeDee said. I liked working for you, Tolliver. But I haveto do what Raoul says, of course. And she moved toward the window.Martin had slumped further down, till his knuckles quite brushed therug. His angry little eyes, glowing with baffled rage, were fixed onDeeDee. Slowly his lips peeled back, exposing every tooth in his head.You, he said, in an ominous growl.DeeDee paused, but only briefly.        *        *       *        *        *Then the enraged roar of a wild beast reverberated through the room._You come back!_ bellowed the infuriated Mammoth-Slayer, and with oneagile bound sprang to the window, seized DeeDee and slung her under onearm. Wheeling, he glared jealously at the shrinking Watt and reached forErika. In a trice he had the struggling forms of both girls captive, oneunder each arm. His wicked little eyes glanced from one to another.Then, playing no favorites, he bit each quickly on the ear.Nick! Erika cried. How dare you!Mine, Mammoth-Slayer informed her hoarsely.You bet I am, Erika said, but that works both ways. Put down thathussy youve got under your other arm.Mammoth-Slayer was observed to eye DeeDee doubtfully.Well, Erika said tartly, make up your mind.Both, said the uncivilized playwright. Yes.No! Erika said.Yes, DeeDee breathed in an entirely new tone. Limp as a dishrag, thelovely creature hung from Martins arm and gazed up at her captor withidolatrous admiration.Oh, you hussy, Erika said. What about St. Cyr?Him, DeeDee said scornfully. He hasnt got a thing, the sissy. Illnever look at him again. She turned her adoring gaze back to Martin.Pah, the latter grunted, tossing DeeDee into Watts lap. Yours. Keepher. He grinned approvingly at Erika. Strong she. Better.Both Watt and DeeDee remained motionless, staring at Martin.You, he said, thrusting a finger at DeeDee. You stay with him. Ha?He indicated Watt.DeeDee nodded in slavish adoration.You sign contract?Nod.Martin looked significantly into Watts eyes. He extended his hand.The contract release, Erika explained, upside-down. Give it to himbefore he pulls your head off.Slowly Watt pulled the contract release from his pocket and held it out.But Martin was already shambling toward the window. Erika reached backhastily and snatched the document.That was a wonderful act, she told Nick, as they reached the street.Put me down now. We can find a cab some--No act, Martin growled. Real. Till tomorrow. After that-- Heshrugged. But tonight, Mammoth-Slayer. He attempted to climb a palmtree, changed his mind, and shambled on, carrying the now pensive Erika.But it was not until a police car drove past that Erika screamed....        *        *       *        *        *Ill bail you out tomorrow, Erika told Mammoth-Slayer, strugglingbetween two large patrolmen.Her words were drowned in an infuriated bellow.Thereafter events blurred, to solidify again for the irateMammoth-Slayer only when he was thrown in a cell, where he pickedhimself up with a threatening roar. I kill! he announced, seizing thebars._Arrrgh!_Two in one night, said a bored voice, moving away outside. Both inBel-Air, too. Think theyre hopped up? We couldnt get a coherent storyout of either one.The bars shook. An annoyed voice from one of the bunks said to shut up,and added that there had been already enough trouble from nincompoopswithout--here it paused, hesitated, and uttered a shrill, sharp,piercing cry.Silence prevailed, momentarily, in the cell-block as Mammoth-Slayer, sonof the Great Hairy One, turned slowly to face Raoul St. Cyr.                    *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EGO MACHINE ***"
